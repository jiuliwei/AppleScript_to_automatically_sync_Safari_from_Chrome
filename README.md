# AppleScript_to_automatically_sync_Safari_from_Chrome
Bookmarks imported from chrome to safari will only add new bookmarks, but will not delete old bookmarks. This script first resets safari bookmarks to empty, and then imports bookmarks, passwords and history from chrome. You can use cron to create a task and run the script once a day to keep safari consistent with chrome.
